	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm currently 23 years old and live in Indianapolis, Indiana. I graduated from Indiana University in August 2018 with a B.S. in Marketing. <br>
	I've always been passionate about technology its constantly evolving to make people's lives better. Before I found Marketing, I tried Graphic Design <br>
	and Computer Science. Although I enjoyed both, I felt as if they were missing something. I liked the creativity of Graphic Design and the analytical side <br>
of Computer Science. After some personal A/B testing, I realized Marketing was something I became passionate about rather quickly.
